## Introduction
The piscine C++ is a serie of project made by the [school 42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) whose purpose is to learn the language C++. As the citation above suggested it, this tutorial is made to be done after learning the programming language C.
## What's in the piscine ?
In the piscine you will face both theory and exercise, the theory is written by [me](https://github.com/TomWeimer) and the exercise are the ones from the school 42. Below are all the modules of this tutorial, with their corresponding notions. The duration of each module is ~7 hours.



| All modules  	          | Notions           |
|:------------------------|:------------------|
| [module00][1]	          | CPP basics (class, syntax, ...)         |
|	[module01][2]           |	CPP basics (memory allocation, references, filestream)                 |	
| [module02][3]  		      | Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overload, canonical form                  | 
|	[module03][4]		        | Inheritance                  |
|	[module04][5]		        | Sub-typing polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces                  |
|	[module05][6]		        | Nested classes and Exceptions                 |
|	[module06][7]		        |  Casts (static, dynamic, reinterpret, const)                 |
|	[module07][8]		        |  Templates (default type, specialization)              |
|	[module08][9]		        |  STL                 |
